# Update Center for free SQL Developer Extensions

## Introduction

In July 2017 Oracle announced to release updates for SQL Developer on a quarterly basis. Installing multiple versions of SQL Developer on the same machine is not a problem. Therefore many developers install a new version as soon as it becomes available. On the first start SQL Developer offers to import the settings of the previous version. This works quite well for most settings. However, all third-party extensions must be installed manually afterwards. This is a cumbersome and boring task. 

This repository maintains an update center for a set of freely available SQL Developer extensions to speed up the configuration of a new SQL Developer installation.

The following SQL Developer extensions are included in the update center:

- [utPLSQL](https://github.com/utPLSQL/utPLSQL-SQLDeveloper)
