# Update Center for free SQL Developer Extensions

## Introduction

In July 2017 Oracle announced to release updates to SQL Developer on a quarterly basis. Installing multiple versions of SQL Developer on the same machine is not a problem. Hence a lot of developers install a new version when it becomes available. On the initial start SQL Developer offers to import settings from the previous version. This works quite well for most of the settings. However, all third party extensions have to be installed manually afterwards. This is a cumbersome, boring task. 

This repository maintains an update center for a set of freely available SQL Developer extensions to speed up the configuration of a new SQL Developer installation.
